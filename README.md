# UdaciCards - Udacity Nanodegree React Project

In this project, a mobile application was built using React Native & Redux. User will be able to create decks, add cards to those decks and take quizzes on those decks. A score will be generated, once quiz is finished. Notification will go out everyday at 12PM, if user forgets to take a quiz for the day. 

## Tested Platforms

This mobile app has only been tested on Android devices, specifically the Samsung S4. I don't own any Apple products so unfortunately I was unable to test on iOS.
